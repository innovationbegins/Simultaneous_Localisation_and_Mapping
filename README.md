# Simultaneous_Localisation_and_Mapping (SLAM)

Matlab implementation of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping.

# Instructions

1. Navigate to the root folder and run setup.m (you can just type 'setup' in the command window).
2. The GUI should open up. There are a number of available maps saved as .mat files in the root folder that can be loaded, or alternatively you can create your own map.
3. When ready, click 'Execute SLAM Simulation'. You can save the resulting grid map as a matrix in a .mat file (along with the map resolution) or a .tiff image.
